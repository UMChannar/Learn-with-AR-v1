# AR Learning App for Pre-Primary Kids

The AR Learning App for Pre-Primary Kids is a mobile-based application designed to facilitate the learning process for young children using augmented reality (AR) technology. This app focuses on teaching subjects such as English, Urdu, Math, and general knowledge, while ensuring that the content is tailored to the understanding level and curriculum standards of pre-primary level kids.

## Key Features

1. **AR Technology:** The app utilizes augmented reality to provide an immersive learning experience for children. AR models are used to visualize and interact with different objects and subjects in real-life environments, enhancing engagement and understanding.

2. **Subject-Based Learning:** The app covers important subjects like English, Urdu, and Math. The lessons are designed to align with the pre-primary curriculum and are presented in a child-friendly manner to avoid overwhelming young learners.

3. **General Knowledge Section:** A dedicated section within the app helps children learn about animals, birds, their names, and associated sounds. This feature expands their general knowledge and introduces them to the world around them.

4. **Daily Routine Objects Detection:** Using the device's camera, the app incorporates a feature that allows children to scan and detect daily routine objects. Once detected, AR models of those objects are displayed, enhancing the child's understanding of real-world objects.

5. **Evaluation Based Learning:** To evaluate the learning progress, the app includes various tests. Each lesson is mapped to a test to ensure comprehension and make the learning process more enjoyable.

6. **Observation Activity:** The app provides an observation activity where children can explore and observe different AR models in the library. This activity encourages creativity and imagination.
